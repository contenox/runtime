# DEVELOPMENT_SLICES.md

> This document tracks development efforts by slice/month, showing what was planned, what was delivered, and what remains for future work.

## Development Approach

This project followed an iterative slice-based development approach where each month focused on a specific theme while building upon previous work.

1. Each slice built upon the previous one with increasing complexity
2. Core infrastructure work (Feb-Mar) enabled the semantic search capabilities (April)
3. Semantic search foundation (April) enabled the document QA features (May)
4. Document QA work (May) provided the basis for task engine development (June)
5. Task engine maturity (June) allowed for demo application development (July)

The approach proved effective for managing complexity, though some features (like the task engine design) required more iteration than initially anticipated. Future slices will focus on stabilizing the architecture while adding new capabilities.

## For Future Slices (Planned)

  - Production Capabilities
  - Complete permission model improvements
  - Implement shared chat sessions
  - Exportable conversation transcripts
  - Model fine-tuning management
  - MCP compatibility implementation
  - Fix the openai model-provider implementation
