# DEVELOPMENT_SLICES.md

> This document tracks development efforts by slice/month, showing what was planned, what was delivered, and what remains for future work.

## Development Approach

This project followed an iterative slice-based development approach where each month focused on a specific theme while building upon previous work.

1. Each slice built upon the previous one with increasing complexity
2. Core infrastructure work (Feb-Mar) enabled the semantic search capabilities (April)
3. Semantic search foundation (April) enabled the document QA features (May)
4. Document QA work (May) provided the basis for task engine development (June)
5. Task engine maturity (June) allowed for demo application development (July)

The approach proved effective for managing complexity, though some features (like the task engine design) required more iteration than initially anticipated. Future slices will focus on stabilizing the architecture while adding new capabilities.

## Future Slices (Planned)

  - Decouple monolithic store architecture
  - Implement state management improvements
  - Add variable composition enhancements
  - Improve error handling and observability
  - Complete permission model improvements
  - Implement shared chat sessions
  - Add audit logging capabilities
  - Begin UI dashboard for compliance tooling
  - Slack bot integrations
  - Exportable conversation transcripts
  - Model fine-tuning management
  - MCP compatibility implementation
  - Fix the ollama model-provider implementation
  - Fix the openai model-provider implementation

- Task engine foundation established but required significant refactoring in July.

### Effort Estimate
- 180-220 hours
- Focused on stabilizing core task execution framework and adding key integrations
