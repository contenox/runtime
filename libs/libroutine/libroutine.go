// Package libroutine provides utilities for managing recurring tasks (routines)
// with circuit breaker protection.
//
// The primary purpose of this package is to provide a robust and managed way to run
// recurring background tasks that might fail, especially those interacting with
// external services or resources. It combines two key concepts:
//
// 1. Circuit Breaker (`Routine`): This pattern prevents an application from
// repeatedly performing an operation that's likely to fail. When failures reach a
// threshold, the "circuit" opens, and calls are blocked for a set period (`resetTimeout`).
// After the timeout, it enters a "half-open" state, allowing one test call.
// If that succeeds, the circuit closes; otherwise, it re-opens. This provides:
//   - Fault Tolerance: Prevents cascading failures by isolating problems.
//   - Resource Protection: Stops wasting resources (CPU, network, memory, API quotas)
//     on calls that are continuously failing.
//   - Automatic Recovery: Gives the failing service/resource time to recover before
//     trying again automatically.
//
// 2. Managed Background Loops (`Pool`): This component manages multiple circuit breakers
// (`Routine` instances) identified by unique keys. It handles the lifecycle of running
// the associated task (`fn`) in a background goroutine, ensuring:
//   - Organization: Keeps track of different background tasks centrally.
//   - Deduplication: Ensures only one instance of a loop runs for a given key,
//     even if `StartLoop` is called multiple times for the same key.
//   - Control: Allows periodic execution (`interval`), on-demand triggering
//     (`ForceUpdate`), context-based cancellation, and manual state resets (`ResetRoutine`).
//
// In essence, use `libroutine` to reliably run background jobs that need to be
// resilient to temporary failures without overwhelming either your application or
// the dependencies they rely on. See `Pool.StartLoop` for the primary entry point
// for running managed routines.
