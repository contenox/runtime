# CATE: Cognitive AI/Agent Transformation Engine

A modular platform for building context-aware agents, semantic search, and task automation — grounded in your data.

## 🚀 Project Vision

CATE aims to become a platform for semantic search and user-defined AI agents that operate within specific contexts.

The project's vision is focused on delivering these core features:

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload PDFs, text files, or URLs to build a knowledge base.
- **Semantic Search**: Search for relevant information within the declared knowledge base.
- **Contextual Chat Sessions**: Ask questions and get answers grounded in your documents.
- **Task Handling**: Create templates for repetitive tasks and execute them with user input.
- **Triggers**: Define conditions that trigger actions based on semantic matches.
- **Steps**: For complex requests, let the agent split the request into a chain of prompts.

## 🔧 What's Under the Hood

CATE combines several technologies to deliver its features:

- **Core Logic**: The main backend service and LLM Gateway, built in **Go**, provides the primary API and orchestration.
- **User Interface**: Dashboards and user interactions are handled by a **React** frontend.
- **Auxiliary Services**: Data processing tasks like document mining and indexing are handled by separate services written in **Python**.
- **Persistence**:
    - **PostgreSQL**: Used for core application state, metadata, and storing original uploaded documents.
    - **OpenSearch**: Manages vector embeddings for semantic search and stores chat history data.
    - **Valkey (Redis Fork)**: Used for caching and managing ephemeral runtime state.
- **Language Models**: Core AI capabilities rely on **Ollama** backends.
- **Security**:
    - Authentication is handled via **JWT tokens**.
    - A **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** pattern helps the UI securely manage token lifecycles.
    - User management and permissions utilize a **custom Access Control system**.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: **NATS** serves as the message bus for asynchronous coordination.
- **Deployment**:
    - The system is designed to run **containerized** (e.g., using Docker).
    - Users are expected to provide external dependencies like **PostgreSQL** and **Valkey**.
    - A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for convenience, but operators typically deploy the CATE container image(s) directly and manage configuration externally.

## ⚙️ WIP - Work In Progress

This project is currently under heavy development. Please check back later for more detailed instructions. Demos, installation, and usage guides will be available within the next day.

Below is a brief "Dev Environment" section you can add to your documentation. It outlines the key steps and commands you need to get started:

## Starting the Development Environment

1. **Prepare the Environment**
   - Copy and edit `.env-example` into a new `.env` file with the proper configuration.
   - Install prerequisites: Docker, Docker Compose, Yarn, and Go.

2. **Build and Run the Backend Services**
   - Run the following to build Docker images and start all services:
     ```bash
     make run
     ```
   - Use `make logs` to tail the backend logs if needed.

3. **Run the Frontend & UI**
   - The UI dev server is bundled with the backend (proxied via the BFF).
   - To start the UI development workflow, run:
     ```bash
     make ui-run
     ```
   - This will build the UI and wait for the backend to be ready before launching the Vite dev server.

4. **API Tests Setup & Execution**
   - Initialize the Python virtual environment and install API test dependencies:
     ```bash
     make api-init
     ```
   - Run your API tests via:
     ```bash
     make api-test
     ```
