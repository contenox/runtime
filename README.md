# CATE: Cognitive AI/Agent Transformation Engine

A modular platform for building context-aware agents, semantic search, and task automation ‚Äî grounded in your data.

## üöÄ Project Vision

CATE aims to become a platform for semantic search and user-defined AI agents that operate within specific contexts.

The project's vision is focused on delivering these core features:

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload PDFs, text files, or URLs to build a knowledge base.
- **Semantic Search**: Search for relevant information within the declared knowledge base.
- **Contextual Chat Sessions**: Ask questions and get answers grounded in your documents.
- **Task Handling**: Create templates for repetitive tasks and execute them with user input.
- **Triggers**: Define conditions that trigger actions based on semantic matches.
- **Steps**: For complex requests, let the agent split the request into a chain of prompts.

## üîß What's Under the Hood

CATE combines several technologies to deliver its features:

- **Core Logic**: The main backend service and LLM Gateway, built in **Go**, provides the primary API and orchestration.
- **User Interface**: Dashboards and user interactions are handled by a **React** frontend.
- **Auxiliary Services**: Data processing tasks like document mining and indexing are handled by separate services written in **Python**.
- **Persistence**:
    - **PostgreSQL**: Used for core application state, metadata, and storing original uploaded documents.
    - **OpenSearch**: Manages vector embeddings for semantic search and stores chat history data.
    - **Valkey (Redis Fork)**: Used for caching and managing ephemeral runtime state.
- **Language Models**: Core AI capabilities rely on **Ollama** backends.
- **Security**:
    - Authentication is handled via **JWT tokens**.
    - A **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** pattern helps the UI securely manage token lifecycles.
    - User management and permissions utilize a **custom Access Control system**.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: **NATS** serves as the message bus for asynchronous coordination.
- **Deployment**:
    - The system is designed to run **containerized** (e.g., using Docker).
    - Users are expected to provide external dependencies like **PostgreSQL** and **Valkey**.
    - A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for convenience, but operators typically deploy the CATE container image(s) directly and manage configuration externally.

## ‚öôÔ∏è WIP - Work In Progress

This project is currently under heavy development.

## Starting the Development Environment

1.  **Prepare the Environment**
    * Copy and edit `.env-example` into a new `.env` file with the proper configuration.
    * Install prerequisites: Docker, Docker Compose, Yarn, and Go.

2.  **Build and Run the Backend Services**
    * Run the following to build Docker images and start all services:
        ```bash
        make run
        ```
    * Use `make logs` to tail the backend logs if needed.

3.  **Run the Frontend & UI**
    * The backend includes a proxy (Backend-for-Frontend/BFF) to handle UI requests and authentication cookies correctly.
    * Start the UI development workflow, which builds UI components and runs the Vite dev server:
        ```bash
        make ui-run
        ```
    * Once Vite is running (you'll see its output in the terminal, often mentioning a port like 5173), **access the application in your browser via the main backend URL** (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` or as configured in your `.env` file or docker-compose port mappings).
    * **Important:** Do *not* use the local URL Vite might display (like `localhost:5173`), as login and other authenticated features will not work correctly through it due to how browser cookies are handled. Always access the UI through the backend's address during development. NOTE: Register
    as `admin@admin.com` for system privileges.

4.  **API Tests Setup & Execution**
    * Initialize the Python virtual environment and install API test dependencies:
        ```bash
        make api-init
        ```
    * Run your API tests via:
        ```bash
        make api-test
        ```
