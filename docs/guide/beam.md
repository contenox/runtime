# Beam: the bundled web UI

Beam is the web UI that ships inside `contenox`. Run one command and the runtime
you already drive from the terminal opens in the browser: the same sessions, the
same chains, the same model and provider config, the same HITL policies. Nothing
is hosted — Beam is served by your local `contenox serve` process, reads and
writes the same SQLite state as the CLI, and stays on `127.0.0.1`.

It is the product's face for work you want to *watch*: you see the workspace the
agent is bound to, which files its policy lets it touch, every tool call as a
card, and — before any gated write or command runs — a diff you approve or reject
yourself.

<!-- TODO(recapture): beam-demo.webm ends on the retired modal approval gate and
     predates the sidebar agent picker + inline permission card. Re-record per the
     "Hero loop" take in docs/development/recording-shot-list.md (include the
     agent-picker flow), then swap this src + poster. -->

*The whole loop in 30 seconds: a prompt in a project workspace, the agent reads
the files, the gated write pauses at the approval gate with a diff, one keypress
approves it, and the agent-view overlay shows what the policy lets it touch.*

---

## 1. Start Beam

If you have not installed Contenox and configured a model yet, do the
[Quickstart](/docs/guide/quickstart/) first — Beam needs a working model like any
other entrypoint.

Install (macOS / Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://contenox.com/install.sh | sh
```

Initialize a workspace once, in the project directory you want to work in:

```bash
contenox init
```

Then start the server from that directory and open the printed URL:

```bash
contenox serve
# Contenox serve <version> ready: http://127.0.0.1:32123
```

Beam is now at **http://127.0.0.1:32123**. The server binds to `127.0.0.1:32123`
by default; override with the `ADDR` and `PORT` environment variables. A bearer
`TOKEN` is optional on loopback and mandatory when you bind a non-loopback
address.

### Remote access and login

When a `TOKEN` is set (required for any non-loopback bind), Beam gates the whole
UI behind a login page: opening the site shows a single **Access token** field.
![Beam's login page: a single Access token field gating the whole UI](/beam-login.png)

Paste the configured `TOKEN` and the server verifies it (constant-time) and
returns a secure, `HttpOnly` session cookie — `SameSite=Strict`, and `Secure`
whenever the connection is HTTPS (including behind a TLS-terminating proxy that
sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`). The token is never stored in the browser's
`localStorage` or placed in the URL; the cookie rides automatically on every
same-origin request, including the `/acp` chat WebSocket upgrade. Sign out from
**Settings → Remote access**, which clears the cookie and returns you to the
login page.

Programmatic clients are unaffected: they keep authenticating with an
`Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` (or `X-API-Key`) header, and the ACP WebSocket
still accepts a `?token=` query parameter. On loopback with no `TOKEN`, no login
is required and the UI loads with zero prompts.

### Allowlisting project directories

The directory you run `contenox serve` in is always available as a session
workspace — it is the default root. To let a browser session pick *other*
project directories as its workspace, extend the allowlist. Any of these work,
and they combine:

```bash
# Positional arguments — additional roots after the serve directory:
contenox serve ~/code/api ~/code/web

# Repeatable flag:
contenox serve --workspace-root ~/code/api --workspace-root ~/code/web

# Environment (OS path-list separated, ':' on Unix):
WORKSPACE_ROOTS="$HOME/code/api:$HOME/code/web" contenox serve
```

A session can only ever choose a workspace inside this allowlist — it bounds what
any browser client can reach.

## 2. A tour of the window

### Session sidebar

The left sidebar lists your chat sessions. **New session** starts a fresh one;
each row links to its conversation and carries a delete button. These are the
same sessions the CLI sees — see [step 3](#3-shared-with-the-cli).

Next to **New session** is a chevron — **New chat with an agent**. It only
appears once you have [registered an external ACP agent](/docs/integrations/agents/external-acp-agents/),
and it opens the [agent picker](#chat-with-a-registered-agent) below. A session
started against an external agent carries that agent's name (`Agent: {name}`) on
its sidebar row, so you can tell at a glance which sessions ran on the native
runtime and which drove a foreign agent.

### Per-session controls

Each session has its own configuration, shown in the chat toolbar (collapsed
under an **Options** dropdown on narrow viewports):

| Control | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Model** | The model this session runs on. |
| **HITL Policy** | The named [HITL policy](/docs/guide/hitl/) that decides which tool calls pause for approval. |
| **Think** | Reasoning effort — `Auto`, `Off`, `Minimal`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `XHigh`. |
| **Token Limit** | The per-turn output token budget. |
| **Workspace** | Which allowlisted directory (see step 1) the session is bound to — chosen on the empty chat before the first message, immutable afterwards. |

Changing a control affects only that session, so you can keep one session on a
local model with a strict policy and another on a hosted model — side by side.

<!-- TODO(recapture): beam-new-chat.png predates the staged-agent picker on the
     empty surface and the sidebar's "New chat with an agent" chevron. Re-shoot

### Chat with a registered agent

Beam is not only a face for the native runtime chain — it can also drive any
[external ACP agent you have registered](/docs/integrations/agents/external-acp-agents/)
(Claude Code, Goose, a home-grown one) from the same window, gated by the same
approvals.

1. Register an agent from the CLI once — `contenox agent add <name> -- <command>`
   (or seed one from the catalog with `contenox agent add <registry-id>`), then
   `contenox agent check <name>` to confirm it answers. See the
   [CLI reference](/docs/reference/contenox-cli/#contenox-agent).
2. In the sidebar, click the **New chat with an agent** chevron. The picker lists
   **Contenox (default)** — the native chain — at the top, then every enabled
   registered agent.
3. Pick an agent and the empty chat stages it: the greeting reads *"Say hello —
   you are talking to {name}, live"*, and the session is bound to that agent the
   moment you send the first message. The binding is fixed for the life of the
   session — an agent is chosen at creation, never switched mid-conversation, so
   there is no in-chat agent switcher.

An external-agent session's toolbar surfaces the config options that *agent*
advertises for the session — for example a Claude Code session exposes its own
**Mode** and **Model** pickers — alongside contenox's own **HITL Policy**
control, so the contenox approval gate still applies to a foreign agent's gated
actions. (The native runtime's per-session Model / Think / Token-Limit controls
do not apply to an external agent and are not shown.)

The agent's turns stream into the transcript like any other, its tool calls
render as cards, and any [permission request](#the-approval-gate) it raises
becomes the same inline card described below.

### Workspace file tree and the agent-view overlay

The **Files** toggle opens the **Workspace** panel: a lazy file tree of the
session's chosen workspace. Click a file and it opens as a read-only tab beside
the chat; directories expand in place.

The tree has an **Agent view** toggle (the shield button). Turn it on and Beam
overlays each file with the verdict the session's HITL policy would return for
it — computed from the *same* policy source the live agent uses, so what you see
is what the agent gets:

- **allowed** — the agent may act on this file without a prompt
- **needs approval** — a matching call pauses at the approval gate first
- **blocked** — the policy denies it outright
- **unreachable** — outside the workspace boundary; the agent cannot see it

It turns "what can this agent touch?" from a question you have to reason about
into something you can read off the tree before you send a prompt.

![Agent view enabled on the workspace tree: the legend and per-file policy verdict dots beside a finished turn with its tool-call cards](/beam-agent-view.png)

### Files and the terminal as tabs

Opened files and the terminal live as tabs in the canvas region beside the chat.
The **Terminal** tab streams a PTY rooted at the session's workspace; type `!`
followed by a command in the chat to run it there, and when the agent itself runs
a shell command mid-turn its output streams into this same tab — every shell line,
yours or the agent's, runs through the runtime's own workspace shell. (Terminal
API routes are on by default for local serve; set `TERMINAL_ENABLED=false` on the
serve process to disable them.)

### Composer shortcuts

The prompt composer understands three inline prefixes:

- **`@`** opens the mention menu — attach a workspace file to the prompt by name,
  with a live preview of the highlighted file.
- **`/`** opens the **command suggestions** menu of the slash-commands the active
  agent advertises. The native runtime and a registered external agent each
  surface their own command set here; picking one drops it into the composer.
- **`!`** runs the rest of the line as a shell command in the workspace Terminal
  tab (above), with no LLM turn.

### The approval gate

When a tool call matches an **approve** rule in the active HITL policy, the run
pauses and Beam raises an **inline permission card** — a warning-styled card that
appears in the transcript flow, anchored to the pending tool call it belongs to,
so the request lives exactly where it happened instead of floating over the page.
The card shows the action's kind and title, the target paths (`path:line`), a
**diff** of a pending file write, and the raw tool input under a collapsible
toggle.

You answer by clicking one of the offered buttons — typically **Allow** or
**Deny**, plus their *always* variants when the policy offers them (each with a
keyboard shortcut). Nothing else responds: clicking elsewhere, pressing Escape,
scrolling, or switching tabs never answers the request — an unanswered request
simply stays pending, which is the correct behaviour (the agent waits). This is
deliberate. The gate is no longer a modal you could accidentally dismiss, and the
old "click outside to deny" footgun is gone; there is likewise no maximize-to-tab
step — the card is already inline.

<!-- TODO(recapture): beam-approval-gate.png shows the RETIRED modal gate and
     contradicts the inline-card prose above. Replace it with the new
     agent-permission-card.png — see the "Permission card" take in
     docs/development/recording-shot-list.md — then re-enable this embed. -->
<!-- ![The inline permission card in the transcript: a pending CHANGELOG.md write rendered as a diff with Allow and Deny](/agent-permission-card.png) -->

Nothing gated runs until you say so, and the decision is recorded in the session
transcript alongside the tool-call card, where the card itself persists. Because
each open session carries its own card, a permission waiting in a *background*
session surfaces an **Approval needed** marker on its sidebar row, so it stays
discoverable while its tab is out of view. Failed turns render inline error cards
(with a *Show details* toggle) instead of vanishing, so a session is a durable,
reviewable record — tool-call cards, diffs, approvals, and errors all survive a
reload.

## 3. Shared with the CLI

Beam is a view onto the runtime, not a separate app. The sessions you start in
the browser are the sessions the CLI lists:

```bash
contenox session list
contenox session switch <name>
```

The same holds for the same work everywhere else: the chains you run in Beam are
the chains you run from the terminal, from the VS Code extension, or from any
[ACP editor](/docs/guide/quickstart/#4-optional-editor-use). One runtime, one set
of sessions and policies, many front ends.
